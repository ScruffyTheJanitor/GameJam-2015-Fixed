# GameJam-2015-Fixed

An updated version of our game created for the 2015 Indies vs Gamers game jam (https://github.com/ScruffyTheJanitor/Indies-VS-Gamers-Game)

- Removed Android/Ios/HTML libraries
- Removed GameJoltAPI implementation + sensitive information
- Reorganized assets
- Restructured class hierarchy

If you simply import it as a gradle project, it should run with no problems.
